## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.6+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

* **pip**: Python's package installer, which usually comes with Python.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/image-to-pdf-converter.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/image-to-pdf-converter.git)
   cd image-to-pdf-converter
   
   ```

   > *Don't forget to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.*

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
   This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's global Python environment.

   ```
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
   The `requirements.txt` file lists all the necessary packages.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   ```

## Usage

With your virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python converter_dark.py

```

**How it works:**

1. Click **"Select Images"** to choose your image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.).

2. Your selected images will appear in the listbox.

3. Click **"Convert to PDF"**.

4. Choose where you want to save your new PDF file.

5. A success message will pop up once your PDF is ready!
